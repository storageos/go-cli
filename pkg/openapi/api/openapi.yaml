          The URL parameter value overrides the "async-max" header value, if any.
          The value of this header defines the timeout duration for the request, it must be set to a valid duration string.
          A duration string is a possibly signed sequence of decimal numbers, each with optional fraction and a unit suffix, such as "300ms", or "2h45m". Valid time units are "ns", "us" (or "µs"), "ms", "s", "m", "h".
          We reject negative or nil duration values.
